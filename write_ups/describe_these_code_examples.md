puts fooey
```

the statement evaluates fooey and returns "not foo"


3)

```
special_number = 1
special_number = 3
```

special_number is assigned the value 1
special_number is reassigned the value of 3

4)

```

```
1 concatenate 2 is evaluated and returns 3


5)

```
a = "foo"
b = "bar"
a + b

```

a is assigned the value "foo"
b is assigned the value "bar"
a concatenate b is evaluated and returns "foo bar"

6)

```

z = z * 3
```
